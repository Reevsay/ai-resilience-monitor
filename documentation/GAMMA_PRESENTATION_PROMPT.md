SLIDE 13: PROCEDURE 1 - CIRCUIT BREAKER PATTERN
Title: "Procedure 1: Circuit Breaker Pattern"
Content:

Purpose: Prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services

Algorithm Overview:
1. Monitor failure count per service
2. If failures >= 5: Open circuit (block requests)
3. After 60s timeout: Enter HALF_OPEN state (test request)
4. If test succeeds: Close circuit (resume normal)
5. If test fails: Reopen circuit (reset timeout)

Key Parameters:
- Threshold: 5 failures
- Timeout: 60 seconds
- States: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN

Dataset:
- failureCount: Integer (0-5)
- state: Enum {CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN}
- lastFailureTime: Timestamp

Implementation: Node.js CircuitBreaker class in src/index.js
APIs Used: Gemini, Cohere, Hugging Face

Content:

Purpose: Collect and calculate real-time performance metrics every 5 seconds

Algorithm Overview:
1. Read metricsHistory from backend
2. Calculate: totalRequests, successfulRequests, failedRequests
3. Calculate: successRate = (successful / total) × 100
4. Calculate: avgLatency = totalLatency / successful
5. Calculate: uptime = currentTime - serverStartTime
6. For each service: Calculate health score (40-40-20 formula)
7. Aggregate all metrics into response object
8. Send to frontend dashboard
9. Update charts and store in localStorage (last 500 requests)

Key Metrics:
📊 Total Requests
✅ Success Rate (%)
⏱️ Average Latency (ms)
🕐 System Uptime (seconds)
❤️ Per-Service Health Scores

Dataset: metricsHistory object, aiServices array, analytics data

SLIDE 17: PROCEDURE 3 - HEALTH SCORE CALCULATION
Title: "Procedure 3: AI-Specific Health Score Calculation"
Content:

Purpose: Generate weighted health scores for AI services (not generic uptime)

Weighted Formula (40-40-20):
🟦 Component 1: Uptime Score (40%)
   uptimeScore = (currentUptime / sessionDuration) × 40

🟦 Component 2: Success Score (40%)
   successScore = (successRate / 100) × 40

🟦 Component 3: Speed Score (20%)
   speedScore = (1 - avgLatency / maxLatency) × 20

Final Score:
   healthScore = uptimeScore + successScore + speedScore
   Normalized: 0 ≤ score ≤ 100

Health Categories:
✅ Excellent (80-100): Green
✅ Good (60-79): Yellow
⚠️ Warning (40-59): Orange
🚨 Critical (0-39): Red

Dataset: service uptime, successRate, avgLatency, totalRequests
Implementation: updateHealthDashboard() in templates/dashboard.html
Why 40-40-20? Uptime + Success are equally critical, Speed is secondary

7. Record: timestamp, service, success/fail, latency, error type
8. Update: success counters, error leaderboard, health scores
9. Store in request history (last 500)
10. Loop back to step 2 (continuous)

Chaos Injection Techniques:
🎲 Random service selection (uniform distribution)
🎲 Random prompt selection (varied complexity)
⏱️ Continuous load generation (no manual trigger)

SLIDE 21: PROCEDURE 5 (PROPOSED) - ML PREDICTION
Title: "Procedure 5: Predictive Failure Detection (Proposed Enhancement)"
Content:

Purpose: Predict failures BEFORE they occur using machine learning

ML Technique: Z-Score Anomaly Detection (3-sigma rule)

Algorithm Overview:
1. Fetch last 50 latency measurements per service
2. Extract recent window (last 20 measurements)
3. Calculate: mean, standard deviation
4. Calculate: Z-score = (currentLatency - mean) / stdDev
5. If |Z-score| > 3: ANOMALY DETECTED
6. Calculate failure probability: prob = |Z| / 5
7. If prob > 80% AND trend degrading:
   → Preemptive circuit breaker open
   → Send alert to dashboard
8. Else: Show warning only

Example:
- Recent latencies: [120, 125, 130, 128, 122, ...] ms
- Mean: 125 ms, StdDev: 5 ms
- Current latency: 145 ms
- Z-score: (145 - 125) / 5 = 4.0 ✅ ANOMALY (>3)
- Probability: 4.0 / 5 = 80% → PREEMPTIVE ACTION

Dataset: Time series latency data (last 50 per service)
ML Model: Z-score statistical model (no training needed)
Implementation Status: 🟡 Proposed (6-8 hours to implement)

SLIDE 28: VIVA DEFENSE - EXPECTED QUESTIONS
Title: "Anticipated Viva Questions & Answers"
Content:

Q1: "Why are your research gaps significant?"
A: 5 meta-gaps appear in 2-5 papers each. External API testing (Gap 1) has 95% relevance - modern apps depend on 10-20 external APIs. Carbon awareness (Gap 3) addresses EU AI Act mandates for Scope 3 emissions tracking.

Q2: "What's novel about your work?"
A: FIRST to test multiple external AI APIs simultaneously. FIRST to integrate carbon footprint tracking into chaos engineering. Netflix (2016) tested internal systems; we test black-box external services.

Q3: "How did you validate your system?"
A: Continuous automated testing over [X] days, [Y] total requests processed, circuit breaker activated [Z] times. Health scores correlate with actual service availability (validated against public status pages).

Q4: "Why 40-40-20 weighting for health score?"
A: Uptime (40%) and Success Rate (40%) are equally critical for AI services - both must be high. Speed (20%) is secondary - users tolerate 500ms latency if response is correct. Validated against industry SLAs (99.9% uptime standard).

Q5: "What are the limitations?"
A: (1) Simulated mode when API keys unavailable, (2) ML model proposed but not implemented, (3) Carbon estimation is proxy-based (not direct measurement), (4) Limited to 3 AI vendors currently.
