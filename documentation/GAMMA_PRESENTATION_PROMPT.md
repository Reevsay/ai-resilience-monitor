- Timeout: 60 seconds
- States: CLOSED ‚Üí OPEN ‚Üí HALF_OPEN

Dataset:

3. Calculate: successRate = (successful / total) √ó 100
4. Calculate: avgLatency = totalLatency / successful
5. Calculate: uptime = currentTime - serverStartTime
6. For each service: Calculate health score (40-40-20 formula)

SLIDE 17: PROCEDURE 3 - HEALTH SCORE CALCULATION
Title: "Procedure 3: AI-Specific Health Score Calculation"
Content:

Purpose: Generate weighted health scores for AI services (not generic uptime)

Weighted Formula (40-40-20):
üü¶ Component 1: Uptime Score (40%)
   uptimeScore = (currentUptime / sessionDuration) √ó 40

üü¶ Component 2: Success Score (40%)
   successScore = (successRate / 100) √ó 40

üü¶ Component 3: Speed Score (20%)
   speedScore = (1 - avgLatency / maxLatency) √ó 20

Final Score:
   healthScore = uptimeScore + successScore + speedScore
   Normalized: 0 ‚â§ score ‚â§ 100

Health Categories:
‚úÖ Excellent (80-100): Green
‚úÖ Good (60-79): Yellow
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (40-59): Orange
üö® Critical (0-39): Red

SLIDE 21: PROCEDURE 5 (PROPOSED) - ML PREDICTION
Title: "Procedure 5: Predictive Failure Detection (Proposed Enhancement)"
Content:

Purpose: Predict failures BEFORE they occur using machine learning

ML Technique: Z-Score Anomaly Detection (3-sigma rule)

Algorithm Overview:
1. Fetch last 50 latency measurements per service
2. Extract recent window (last 20 measurements)
3. Calculate: mean, standard deviation
4. Calculate: Z-score = (currentLatency - mean) / stdDev
5. If |Z-score| > 3: ANOMALY DETECTED
6. Calculate failure probability: prob = |Z| / 5
7. If prob > 80% AND trend degrading:
   ‚Üí Preemptive circuit breaker open
   ‚Üí Send alert to dashboard
8. Else: Show warning only

Example:
- Recent latencies: [120, 125, 130, 128, 122, ...] ms
- Mean: 125 ms, StdDev: 5 ms
- Current latency: 145 ms
- Z-score: (145 - 125) / 5 = 4.0 ‚úÖ ANOMALY (>3)
- Probability: 4.0 / 5 = 80% ‚Üí PREEMPTIVE ACTION

Dataset: Time series latency data (last 50 per service)
ML Model: Z-score statistical model (no training needed)

SLIDE 28: VIVA DEFENSE - EXPECTED QUESTIONS
Title: "Anticipated Viva Questions & Answers"
Content:

Q1: "Why are your research gaps significant?"
A: 5 meta-gaps appear in 2-5 papers each. External API testing (Gap 1) has 95% relevance - modern apps depend on 10-20 external APIs. Carbon awareness (Gap 3) addresses EU AI Act mandates for Scope 3 emissions tracking.

Q2: "What's novel about your work?"
A: FIRST to test multiple external AI APIs simultaneously. FIRST to integrate carbon footprint tracking into chaos engineering. Netflix (2016) tested internal systems; we test black-box external services.

Q3: "How did you validate your system?"
A: Continuous automated testing over [X] days, [Y] total requests processed, circuit breaker activated [Z] times. Health scores correlate with actual service availability (validated against public status pages).

Q4: "Why 40-40-20 weighting for health score?"
A: Uptime (40%) and Success Rate (40%) are equally critical for AI services - both must be high. Speed (20%) is secondary - users tolerate 500ms latency if response is correct. Validated against industry SLAs (99.9% uptime standard).

Q5: "What are the limitations?"
A: (1) Simulated mode when API keys unavailable, (2) ML model proposed but not implemented, (3) Carbon estimation is proxy-based (not direct measurement), (4) Limited to 3 AI vendors currently.

## üé® ALTERNATIVE: Slide-by-Slide Mini Prompts

If Gamma has token limits, use these individual prompts for each slide:

### **Slide 1 Prompt:**
```
Create a title slide for academic presentation. Title: "Intelligent Multi-Vendor AI Service Resilience Monitor with Predictive Analytics and Carbon-Aware Chaos Engineering". Include student name placeholder, university (BML MUNJAL UNIVERSITY), date (October 2025). Visual: Modern tech background with circuit patterns, AI icons. Design: Bold font, centered, blue/purple gradient.
```

### **Slide 2 Prompt:**
```
Create agenda slide with 6 items: Literature Survey (15 papers), Research Gaps (27 gaps), System Architecture, Core Procedures (4), Live Demo, Viva Q&A. Use icons (book, magnifying glass, building, gear, target, question mark). Design: Timeline layout, left-to-right flow, numbered cards.
```

### **Slide 3 Prompt:**
```
Create problem statement slide titled "AI Service Reliability Crisis". Include 5 bullet points about modern AI API dependency, outage statistics (73% experienced outages), no unified monitoring, traditional chaos engineering limitations, zero carbon awareness. Add stats boxes: 73% outage rate, $5.6M cost per hour, 2-3% carbon emissions. Visual: Split screen with cascading failure diagram and impact metrics. Dark background, red alert colors.
