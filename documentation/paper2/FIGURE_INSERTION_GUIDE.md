## 🎨 Formatting Guidelines (Springer LNCS)

### Image Sizing
- **Full width figures:** Width = 12.2 cm (single column)
- **Recommended:** 85-90% of column width for margins
- **Charts/graphs:** Can be smaller (70-80%)
- **Tables:** Full width for readability

### Image Quality
- **Format:** PNG (already provided)
- **Resolution:** 300 DPI minimum (screenshots are high quality ✅)
- **File size:** All under 300KB ✅

### Caption Format
```
Figure X. [Caption text starts with capital, ends with period.]
```

Example:
```
Figure 1. System dashboard in idle state showing complete monitoring interface.
```

### Placement
- Place figure **after** first reference in text
- Use: "as shown in Figure X" or "see Figure X"
- Center align all figures
- Add 6pt spacing before and after

### Cross-Referencing in Word
1. Write: "The system architecture (Figure 1) shows..."
2. Insert → Cross-reference → Reference type: Figure
3. Select figure number
4. This auto-updates if figure numbers change

## 📝 Word Template Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Document Structure
```
1. Open splnproc1703.docm
2. Save As: "AI_Resilience_Monitoring_Paper.docx"
3. Fill in title, authors, affiliations
4. Copy abstract and keywords
```

### Step 2: Add Body Content
```
1. Copy section text from RESEARCH_PAPER_WITH_FIGURES.md
2. Paste into template maintaining heading styles
3. Format using template styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, Body Text)
```

### Step 3: Insert Figures
```
For each figure location:
1. Place cursor where figure should go
2. Insert → Picture → Browse
3. Navigate to: research-paper/component-screenshots/
4. Select appropriate PNG file
5. Resize to recommended width
6. Center align (Ctrl+E)
7. Press Enter to create new line below
8. Right-click image → Insert Caption
9. Type caption text
10. Format caption as "Figure Caption" style
```

### Step 4: Add References
```
1. Reference figures in text BEFORE they appear
2. Use Insert → Cross-reference for figure numbers
3. Example: "The monitoring interface (Fig. 1) demonstrates..."
```

### Step 5: Final Checks
```
✅ All figures referenced in text
✅ Captions numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
✅ Images centered and properly sized
✅ Captions use correct style
✅ File size under conference limit
✅ All images high quality (not pixelated)
```
